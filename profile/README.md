# üßë‚Äçüç≥ Welcome to Alacarte!

Alacarte is a work-in-progress web app to help people discover and plan recipes for their weekly meal rotation.

## What prompted Alacarte?

Every week, I sit down with my partner to figure out what meals we're going to eat that week. But, we're always cooking the same meals - that's where Alacarte comes in.

I wanted a place to keep my favourite recipes, discover new ones, and track which meals I'm cooking on which days.

That's the goal of Alacarte - but there's still lots of work to do to get there! üå±

## Can I contribute to Alacarte?

At this point I'm still developing solo - but feel free to email me if you want to discuss anything.
